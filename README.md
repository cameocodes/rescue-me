## Description
### The Problem
A large percentage of the hundreds of thousands of pets that enter the pound system every year are euthanised due to space constraints. Rescues can be disjointed with poor websites, no social media skills which makes it harder for potential owners to find their next best friend.

Owners who can no longer look after their dog, who have inherited a pet from a deceased family member, or due to a change in circumstances can no longer have a pet struggle to find rescues that are willing to take surrendered animals. This means even more pets are put into the pound system.


(Good reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532565/)
### The Solution
**Rescue Me** is a platform for pounds, shelters and rescue organisations to advertise their pets in a centeralised location, giving the public an easier way to find pets available for adoption. It allows the public to advertise pets that they can no longer care for in a space where any registered rescue organisations can see them. 

**Rescue Me** streamlines what is often a complicated and confusing adoption process - applications to adopt a pet can be submitted, reviewed and approved all within the website.

## Trello Board
### [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8GPSQEcI)
Trello was an invaluable tool to organise my thoughts and form a cohesive plan for the development of my site. I started with lists like 'Brainstorming', 'Features' and 'Technical Requirements' which I was then able to break down into more specific topics once I knew where I was headed. I used labels to batch my tasks together and make it easier to complete several similar tasks at once. The final Trello setup that I used during the development of the site looked like this:

## Mood Board and Inspiration
### [Pinterest Board](https://www.pinterest.com.au/hello9327/rails-site-inspo/)
Initially I wanted to have a nice clean, crisp design similar to the Google Material Design style so it features heavily in my Pinterest board.

## Wireframes
### [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/D6zxse7wpLjgmB893NXtTWNs/Rescue-Website?node-id=48%3A16)
I decided I wanted to use a grey-based theme with orange as a feature colour. I made a horrible theme that strongly featured a bright orange colour and - after getting some very blunt feedback - spent a day seriously considered quitting the course. With some guidance from Babs I settled on a light grey theme with a light purple as a feature colour. Material Design just didn't seem to work for me so I settled on a basic flat UI look and ended up being pretty happy with my final design.
